# Kenzie Academy Challenge: Reimplement Array Methods

## Running the Unit Tests

- Use console.assert for each unit test.

## Reflection

For a software developer, what are the benefits of good unit tests? Are there any drawbacks to writing unit tests?

- Unit testing helps you focus on what the outcome of a piece of code should be. It also gives you confidence that your code is working properly when it passes your tests and reduces the amount of bugs you will encounter. Improperly written unit tests could give you a false sense of closure on code that still needs work; furthermore, in some cases, writing unit tests is a waste of time as the output of a function may be self explanatory and you are unlikely to run into any bugs, especially if you are very familiar with the concept and have written such code before.
